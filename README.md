# TACOS-spec
TACOS Framework v2

This spec has been revised in partnership with an ongoing open source maintainer research study. The primary security tools in use today by maintainers include free automated dependency update tools, static analysis tools, and some fuzzing usage. The maintainers we've spoken with so far are taking the security of their source code and build pipelines seriously with a blend of automation, ecosystem-specific packaging tools, and a variery of best practices that are shared within ecosystems. There is still a noticeable lack of reliable income allocated to independent open source maintainers who require a more professional suite of security tools, or additional time to recruit and upskill new community members to contribute to security and maintenance work. This shows up noticeably in a lack of available community members for code reviews. Finally, maintainers have told us some of the ways that they evaluate new dependency considerations, as well as new contributions. We are iterating to reflect key project metrics that signal security and long-term outlook risk.

## Overview
TACOS is a framework for understanding and evaluating  the secure software development practices of open source packages. Its purpose is to identify gaps and opportunities to support the packages and people that underpin our shared software supply chains. It can be used to clarify where an organization should proactively invest in its open source dependencies, or choose to stop using a package. It can also be used to proactively assess any open source package for alignment with the risk profile of where the package may be used. 

The result of collecting this data is a machine-readable file that is complementary to other software security supply chain documents, such as Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), Vulnerability Disclosure Reports (VDR), and Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange (VEX) documents. We call this point in time document an attestation report. It is a record of what secure development practices were known and unknown at the time of its creation for a particular package. 

## TACOS statements
At the heart of TACOS attestation reports are statements about the open source software development practices of an upstream open source software package. These statements are generally made at the package level, with statements about specific versions possible in a given attestation report (see below).

There are two types of statements. Attestation statements attest to adherence to a particular secure development standard. Each attestation statement must have a value of:  True, False, or `NOASSERTION`. Metadata statements describe a particular attribute of the package, or reference a document with further information (such as a URL or SBOM). 

## Assessments
The specification defines what assessment should be performed for any TACOS statement that is associated with an assessment. Assessment definitions may include references to third-party assessment standards. If such a reference exists, assessors should familiarize themselves with the third-party standard in order to inform their assessment. 

## Attestation reports
A TACOS attestation report is a collection of TACOS statements. Each report must have:
  - the creation date in ISO 8601 format (see, eg, https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/document-creation-information/#69-created-field)
  - an indication of the identity of the reportâ€™s creator (see, eg, https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/document-creation-information/#68-creator-field)

In accordance with U.S. government standards, new attestation reports for a software product should be generated whenever a new major release is made [src](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/secure-software-self-attestation_common-form_508.pdf).

At this time, we have not formally specified the structure of an attestation report.
